# 365  Days of code

## Jan 1, 2019
  *I am publicly committing to 365 days of code. Everyday I will code for atleast one hour or learn some new stuff related to coding and log my progress here.*
  
## day 1 (Jan 1, 2019)
. Lets see how this turns out. Today I converted poc my [india-elections](<https://github.com/v-adhithyan/india-elections>) project to load some dynamic data.

## day 2 (Jan 2, 2019)
  Fixed a bug in my [india-elections](<https://github.com/v-adhithyan/india-elections>) where cleaned tweet was not used to generate word cloud.
  
## day 3 (Jan 3, 2019)
  Added sentry integration to my [india-elections](<https://github.com/v-adhithyan/india-elections>) where cleaned tweet was not used to generate word cloud, and fixed
  environment variable import error in production.
  
## day 4 (Jan 4, 2019)
  Fixed a simple bug in my [india-elections](<https://github.com/v-adhithyan/india-elections>) project to add allowed hosts, where in the app was not loading
  in production.
  
## day 5 (Jan 5, 2019)
  Optimized my [india-elections](<https://github.com/v-adhithyan/india-elections>) project, so that
  instead of generating wordcloud for a same query again and again, on first generation
  the file path will be saved in db and on subsequent calls to same query the file
  will be served from already generated one.
  
## day 6 (Jan 6, 2019)
  Modified clean tweet function for my [india-elections](<https://github.com/v-adhithyan/india-elections>) to exclude
  retweets from visualizations. Also the complexity is coming up
  a way to not store tweets but also it should not hinder visualizations.
  
## day 7 (Jan 7, 2019)
  Read 2 python related tutorials. <https://www.pingshiuanchua.com/blog/post/2018-trending-english-searches-on-google-us-uk-in-sg-my-ph-google-trends> <https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/>
  
## day 8 (Jan 8, 2019)
  Read a white paper regarding analysing sentiments from tweets to predict election results.

## day 9 (Jan 9, 2019)
  Studied about building dashboards with python. <https://pusher.com/tutorials/live-dashboard-python> <https://blog.sicara.com/bokeh-dash-best-dashboard-framework-python-shiny-alternative-c5b576375f7f?gi=bb613743bcf1> I think this will be useful for my india elections project. After finalising v1 of project, have to come up with dashboard.
  
## day 10 (Jan 10, 2019)
  Mostly into reading pycoder issue 350 and trying out some stuff from tutorial.
